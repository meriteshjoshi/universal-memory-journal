00:00 I used to start my Claude Code
projects completely wrong.
00:04 I typed Claude into my terminal
and just start freestyle prompting
00:07 with no planning, no setup,
and no system for building.
00:11 It was like trying to build
a house without blueprints.
00:14 I eventually got something
built, but it was messy,
00:16 inefficient, and full of problems.
00:18 I could have avoided.
00:19 But after building dozens of projects
with Claude Code over the past year,
00:23 I've discovered a simple three part
system that makes every project
00:27 10 x easier to build from day one.
00:29 And in this video, I'm gonna save you
months of frustration and wasted time
00:34 by sharing the exact system that I use
to start every new Claude Code project.
00:39 I call it the PSB system
for plan, setup, and build.
00:43 Phase one is plan.
00:45 This is where you set up
your project for success.
00:47 Before you write a single line of code.
00:50 We'll cover the two critical
questions I asked myself before
00:53 building and creating a project
spec doc that combines both product
00:57 requirements and engineering design.
00:59 So Claude can build exactly what
you want the way that you want it.
01:03 Phase two is set up.
01:04 This is where you configure
Claude code with everything that
01:07 it needs to build effectively.
01:09 We will cover my seven step set up
checklist for Claude Code from setting
01:12 up a GitHub repo and creating your
claude.md file to advanced features
01:17 like plugins, MCPs, and custom commands.
01:20 Phase three is build.
01:22 This is where you'll start writing code
first by building your MVP and then
01:26 the rest of your project milestones.
01:28 We'll cover the three development
workflows that I use for every
01:31 project, the general workflow
for single features, issue-based
01:35 development for staying organized and
multi-agent development, for working
01:39 on multiple features simultaneously.
01:41 Plus, I'll share the most important
tips that I've learned to keep
01:44 your building process with thought
code productive and efficient.
01:48 So whether you're starting your first
Claude Code project, or you already
01:51 use Claude Code every day, I guarantee
that you're gonna learn something from
01:54 this video that's gonna help you build
faster, that smarter with Claude Code,
01:59 even if you don't use a whole system.
02:00 And just apply a handful of
these tips that I'm gonna share.
02:04 But before we dive in, I'm Avthar and
I teach people about the best AI coding
02:08 tools and how to get the most out of them,
no matter your skill or experience level.
02:13 So if trying to level up with AI
coding tools, maybe it's for your job
02:16 or for your business, or maybe even
a side project, please subscribe to
02:20 the channel and turn on notifications
for more videos about AI coding.
02:24 Alright, with that out the way,
let's get into phase one of
02:28 starting a new Claude Code project.
02:29 And that's planning.
02:31 We're gonna cover the two most
important questions to ask yourself.
02:34 How to create a project spec doc that
captures both product and engineering
02:38 requirements and how to use AI to help
you plan at every step of the way.
02:42 And look, I get it.
02:44 Planning sounds boring.
02:45 You wanna start coding.
02:46 But trust me on this one, spending
just 15 minutes, planning a project
02:50 upfront will save you hours, sometimes
even days of frustration down the line.
02:55 Now before I even open Claude
Code, I do a brainstorm of what
02:58 I want to achieve with a project.
02:60 Specifically.
03:01 I ask myself two questions and
note down the answers using a
03:04 pen and paper or a Google Doc.
03:06 The first question that I asked
myself before building is, what
03:10 are you actually trying to do?
03:11 Or what is the goal of your project?
03:14 Are you trying to learn a new technology?
03:16 Are you trying to validate
an idea with customers?
03:18 Are you building an alpha version
of a product or feature, or
03:21 are you just prototyping to
see if something is possible?
03:24 Getting clear about what you're
actually trying to do changes everything
03:28 about how you approach the project.
03:30 It tells you what's important to
build versus what you can skip.
03:34 For example, if you're just trying
to prototype to see if a feature is a
03:37 good idea, you can just focus on the
core functionality for that feature.
03:41 You don't need to worry about
production ready code or edge cases.
03:44 You can move fast and break things, but
if you're building something you wanna
03:48 ship to real users, then you need to
think about things like security, error,
03:52 handling, edge cases, and all the details
that make your product feel polished.
03:57 A key thing to keep in mind
when you're planning is that
03:59 the clearer you are, the better.
04:01 Claude will understand what you're
trying to achieve and build accordingly.
04:05 The second question I ask myself in the
plan phase is, what are the milestones
04:09 of functionality that you want?
04:11 This is where you can start breaking
down your project into clear phases.
04:15 What does version one look like?
04:16 Maybe it just focuses on one core feature.
04:19 What are you okay with leaving
out or saving for future versions?
04:22 then you can apply that same thinking to
version two, version three, and so on.
04:27 For most projects, I like to think
in terms of an MVP or minimum
04:31 viable product, and then one or
two versions of improvements.
04:34 The MVP is an absolute minimum.
04:36 You need to validate your idea
or prove that the concept works.
04:40 And then in future versions you
can add things like scaffolding,
04:43 polish or optimizations.
04:45 Next up in phase one is
using AI to help you plan.
04:49 Once you have your brainstorm, this
is where you can use AI to help you
04:52 flesh out the plan for your project.
04:54 And here's my pro tip for
using any AI to help you plan,
04:58 tell it to ask you questions.
04:60 For example, when I start a new project,
I give Claude my brainstorm in a
05:04 markdown file and ask, "Hey Claude,
I wanna build this project. What are
05:08 the three most important questions I
need to answer in order to build an
05:11 MVP of this successfully?" Claude will
then ask me clarifying questions about
05:15 the brainstorm to help me spot things
that I haven't fully thought through,
05:19 or decisions that need to be made.
05:21 And by answering these questions,
I get way more clarity about what
05:24 I'm actually trying to build.
05:26 The cool thing is that you can repeat
this trick of getting the AI to
05:29 ask you questions for any aspect of
the planning or building process,
05:34 whether it's figuring out product
requirements or technical tool choices,
05:37 or just debugging an gnarly issue.
05:40 The other tool that I use for planning
is just having a conversation with a
05:44 Claude assistant or ChatGPT, using voice
mode . I literally just talk through
05:48 my project idea out loud, talking
about the different features that I
05:52 want the user flows, and then I ask it
to summarize our conversation and put
05:56 it in a markdown file that I can use
as a starting point with Claude Code.
05:60 Having a voice conversation with
AI is super useful in the planning
06:03 process ' cause that's when your ideas
are still fuzzy and sometimes it's
06:07 hard to write things down because
you don't even know what you think.
06:10 And so saying it out loud helps you
process your ideas a lot more easily.
06:14 Alright, so now we get to the main
deliverable of the planning phase,
06:18 which is your project spec doc.
06:19 The project spec has two main
parts, the product requirements
06:23 and the engineering requirements.
06:25 It contains the essential product
ideas and engineering design
06:28 information to help Claude Code
successfully build your project.
06:33 I'll note that how detailed your project
spec doc needs to be depends on your
06:36 project goal and your milestones.
06:38 This is why it's important
to get clear on those first.
06:41 Now if you worked at a software company
before, you might be familiar with a
06:44 product requirements DOC or PRD and
Engineering Design Docs, or EDDs, the
06:50 project Spec Doc is basically a much
more lightweight version of that, but
06:54 tailored for building with Claude Code.
06:56 Let's dive into the first part
of your project Spec doc, which
06:59 is the product requirements.
07:00 The product requirements are about
what you're building and why.
07:04 It answers three key questions.
07:06 Who is a product for?
07:07 What problems does it solve,
and what should the product do?
07:10 This is where you exercise
your creativity, your insight,
07:13 and your product sense.
07:15 You need to think about who
you're building for and what
07:17 problems you wanna solve for them.
07:19 Sometimes that person is you, so
take some time to think about it.
07:22 And here's what I've learned
about product requirements.
07:25 You'll likely need to spend some
time outlining exactly what you
07:28 want in terms of how the problems
are solved from a user perspective.
07:32 ' cause if you're not specific about
the user interactions that you want,
07:35 Claude might make assumptions and
you might not like what you get.
07:38 For example, if you're building
a journaling app, don't just say
07:42 users can create journal entries.
07:44 Be specific.
07:45 What does creating an entry look like?
07:47 Do they start with a blank page
or do they start with prompts?
07:49 Can they add photos?
07:51 Can they edit past entries?
07:53 What does a workflow look like?
07:55 The more specific you are about the
user experience that you want, the
07:58 better Claude will be at building it.
08:00 Another key thing to keep in mind
for the product requirements is don't
08:04 try to build everything at once.
08:06 Break your project down into
clear milestones for capabilities.
08:10 This is where the milestone question we
asked ourselves earlier comes in handy.
08:14 What are the most important things
to build first and define what done
08:18 looks like for each milestone so
you have a clear target to hit.
08:21 The final pro tip around product
requirements is that if you're
08:24 not sure about your product
requirements, that's totally okay.
08:28 Build version one first, and then based
on what you like or dislike about it, you
08:32 can create a plan for version two, iterate
on your product requirements as you build.
08:37 Alright.
08:38 All right.
08:38 The second part of your project
spec is the technical requirements
08:41 or engineering design doc.
08:43 While the product requirements cover
what you're building, the engineering
08:46 design is about how you're building it.
08:49 The first and most important part
of your engineering requirements
08:52 is choosing your tech stack.
08:54 Now, depending on the type of product
that you're building, you'll need to
08:57 decide on things like what programming
language you're going to use, your
09:01 preferred front-end framework.
09:02 Backend framework, things like your
database choice, your hosting and
09:06 info provider, as well as any other
details about the components that
09:10 you'd like to use in your project.
09:12 And here's why that
matters for Claude Code.
09:14 If you don't specify your stack, Claude
might just inject random technology
09:18 choices that you might not want.
09:20 So I always start by being rarely
explicit about my stack preferences.
09:23 If you are looking for inspiration,
here's my preferred stack for
09:27 building web applications.
09:28 For the front end, I use Vercel for
Hosting Next JS as a framework, tailwind
09:33 for styling and Shadcn for components.
09:36 For the backend and database,
I like MongoDB or Supabase
09:40 depending on the project.
09:41 For authentication and login, I use Clerk.
09:44 And for payments, you
can't go wrong with Stripe.
09:46 For email, I've been enjoying
Resend recently and for backend
09:50 hosting if I need it I use Digital
Ocean . For object storage.
09:54 My go-to is Cloudflare R2.
09:56 And for AI features I tend to use
Anthropic models, but for images I
10:00 use nano banana from Google Gemini.
10:03 Now if you prefer different
technologies, that's totally fine.
10:06 You don't have to use this stack.
10:07 It's just a suggestion.
10:09 But the main thing is that you should be
clear about what you want Claude to use.
10:13 But what if you're not sure about what
to use or even what components of the
10:17 stack you need in the first place?
10:19 The answer here is just ask Claude
. Describe your requirements and ask Claude
10:24 code to create a research report with
options and recommended choices for you.
10:28 Claude Code has web search built
in so it can look up the latest
10:31 docs, tools, and frameworks and
give you informed recommendations.
10:35 The second part of your technical
requirements is defining
10:38 your technical architecture.
10:40 This includes things like your system
design, overview, the key components of
10:44 your app and how they interact, as well
as your database schema, your API design,
10:49 if you have one, and other technical
details that matter for your project.
10:53 Now I usually delegate most of this
to Claude, but if you're using Claude
10:56 Code at work or on a team, you likely
wanna be more prescriptive with the
10:60 implementation details in order to follow
the best practices that your team uses.
11:05 For example, if you're working at a
company that has specific patterns
11:08 for system design, you might wanna
document those in your engineering
11:11 design so that Claude follows them.
11:13 And part of this technical architecture
step often involves actually provisioning
11:17 the infrastructure that you need.
11:19 So once you've decided what infra you
want to use, go ahead and provision it.
11:23 Create your database.
11:24 Set up your hosting, create your API keys.
11:27 Do it all now so that Claude can
move fast when you start building.
11:30 So that wraps up the planning phase.
11:32 you're now ready to move to phase
two, which is Claude Code setup.
11:36 Alright.
11:37 Phase two is a setup phase.
11:39 This is where we're gonna cover the
seven step checklist that I use to set up
11:42 Claude Code for successful development.
11:45 And by the end of this section, your
Claude Code is gonna feel like a perfectly
11:49 tuned instrument with all the shortcuts,
automations, and context that it needs
11:53 to build your project effectively.
11:55 Heads up that you don't need to use
all the things I recommend in the setup
11:58 section to improve your existing workflow.
12:01 Just pick and choose the things that
you feel is relevant to your project.
12:04 Step one in the setup checklist is
set up a GitHub repo for your project.
12:09 Now you can just build locally
with Git, but I strongly recommend
12:13 setting up a GitHub repo from
the start for a few key reasons.
12:17 First setting up a GitHub repo enables
you to use Claude Code on the web and
12:22 mobile so you can code from anywhere.
12:24 Second, you get access to the GitHub
CLI and the Claude Code gitHub Action.
12:28 This is super useful for reading
project and branch history
12:32 and creating pull requests.
12:33 And the GitHub action is useful
for automated PR reviews and
12:37 mentioning Claude to handle issues.
12:39 Third.
12:40 Many infrastructure providers like
Vercel enable you to deploy just by
12:44 connecting a GitHub repo and in the
case of Vercel It also supports deploy
12:48 previews for each branch of your project.
12:51 This makes using branches a no
brainer for developing new features
12:54 or trying new product directions
while keeping your main branch stable.
12:58 Generally, I ask Claude Code to
use a new branch for each big new
13:02 feature that it develops, and then
when it's done, we merge or submit
13:05 a PR against the main branch.
13:07 Fourth and finally, a GitHub repo
enables issue-based development.
13:11 This helps keep your project super
organized as it makes GitHub issues
13:15 the source of truth for things
like bugs and feature requests.
13:18 And it also means that you can use
multiple instances of Claude Code to
13:22 tackle multiple issues at the same time.
13:25 We'll cover issue-based development and
multi-agent development in more depth
13:30 in the build section later in the video.
13:32 Step two in the setup checklist is
creating your environment variable file.
13:37 To do this first, ask Claude to
create an example ENV file based on
13:41 your project spec and tech stack.
13:43 Then create a copy of that and fill
in your needed credentials and API
13:47 keys so that Claude can build with
them without stopping to ask you.
13:51 Step three is setting
up your claude.md file.
13:54 You can think of your Claude.md
file as your project's memory.
13:57 It's always included in context for every
chat that you have with Claude Code.
14:02 A big thing to remember about
your Claudemd file is that it
14:05 is finite so don't bloat it.
14:08 You wanna keep it focused on
the most important information.
14:11 So what goes inside a Claudemd file?
14:14 Now, there's no one size fits all
answer, but in general, you wanna
14:17 put information about your project
that Claude absolutely needs to know.
14:21 Here are some suggestions
about what to include.
14:24 First, the project goals and a
project architecture overview.
14:28 This gives Claude a big picture, grounding
of the project and the folder layout.
14:33 Next is a design style guide
and user experience guidelines.
14:36 This keeps your code that is
generated by Claude, aligned with
14:40 your project and design goals.
14:42 Then constraints and policies.
14:44 This prevents unsafe or forbidden actions.
14:46 For example, you can tell Claude never to
push to the main branch directly or always
14:51 use environment variables for secrets.
14:54 Then repository etiquette.
14:55 For example, telling Claude when to use
things like PRs versus direct merges, how
15:00 to name branches and other git workflows.
15:03 You can also put frequently used commands
like those for building and testing so
15:07 that Claude can run them without asking.
15:10 And you can also include testing
instructions and other rules and
15:13 constraints that you want Claude
to follow in your Claude.md file.
15:17 One of the most impactful ways that
I've found to keep your Claude.md
15:21 Concise is to link off to other files.
15:24 Tell Claude about files that
have important context in the
15:27 Claude.md file and tell it to
reference them for the full picture.
15:31 For example, you can link off to your
project spec doc from the plan phase,
15:35 as well as an Architecture MD file
versus repeating that information.
15:39 That way you can give Claude
important information about your
15:42 project without unnecessarily
clogging up the context window.
15:45 Now finally, don't worry about making
your Claude.md file perfect on day one.
15:50 You'll build it up iteratively
as you work on your project, and
15:53 we'll cover more about this in the
build phase later in the video.
15:57 Step four in the checklist is to
set up automated documentation.
16:02 Automated documentation is my term for
a set of documents that is separate
16:06 from your Claude.md file that maintains
context about your project, which
16:10 Claude can read when it needs to.
16:12 These are the sort of docs that you link
off to in your Claude MD . You ask Claude
16:17 to keep these docs up to date as you work.
16:19 That way you always have the
latest context in your sessions.
16:23 This is incredibly useful for development
planning or even just refreshing your
16:27 memory about a project or feature.
16:29 I have four core documents that
I set up for every project.
16:33 Doc.
Number one is the architecture.md file.
16:36 Architecture.md documents your
system design, app structure, and
16:40 how the major components interact.
16:42 You wanna keep this updated
after you add big features.
16:46 Document number two is a change log md.
A change log is just a list of things
16:51 that's change in your project over time.
16:53 It's common for companies to put
out change logs whenever they
16:55 do new releases or at the end
of every week or every month.
16:59 This is helpful for Claude Code
projects because it helps you see
17:02 what work has been done, and also
gives Claude an overview of how
17:05 the project has evolved over time.
17:07 Doc number three is a project status doc.
17:10 This doc covers three things.
17:12 What are the project milestones?
17:14 What have you already accomplished
in relation to those milestones and
17:17 where did you end off last time?
17:19 The project status file is a personal
favorite of mine 'cause I tend to work in
17:23 bursts and sometimes don't touch a project
for a few days or even a few weeks.
17:27 And so it's helpful for me and Claude
to pick back up right where we left off.
17:32 Doc number four is reference
docs for key features.
17:36 These are technically optional
since you can just use the code
17:39 base search subagent in Claude Code.
17:41 But I like building these to get a high
level overview of a feature so that I can
17:45 plan how to improve it or fix bugs in it.
17:48 For example, in an iOS app that I was
building, I had reference docs for
17:52 onboarding and push notifications.
17:54 And in a web app that I was building,
I had docs about how payments were
17:58 implemented, about how time zones
worked in an email reminder feature
18:02 and other docs documenting rules
around core product functionalities.
18:06 Finally, how do you
keep these docs updated?
18:09 The answer is to ask Claude to
automatically update the docs as it
18:13 works either with an instruction in
your Claude.md, or using a custom
18:17 slash command that Claude can
run after it finishes a feature.
18:21 This is my personal preference for
how to do automated documentation.
18:24 Step number five in the setup checklist
is to set up plugins for your project.
18:29 Plugins extend Claude Code with
specialized commands and workflows that
18:33 make development faster and easier.
18:35 A plugin consists of any combination
of slash commands, sub-agents,
18:40 MCP servers, hooks, and skills.
18:43 Plugins enable you to easily take the
best customizations from other Claude
18:47 Code users and use them in your own
projects without recreating them.
18:52 You can find plugins using one of
the many plugin marketplaces around
18:55 and you can manage them using the
slash plugins command in Claude Code.
18:60 And if you're looking for inspiration,
here's some plugins that I
19:03 recommend using for new projects.
19:05 First up is the Anthropic
front-end plugin.
19:08 This adds specialized skills for front-end
development, giving you better UIs and
19:12 avoiding that dreaded purple gradient.
19:14 Second is the anthropic feature
dev plugin, which helps streamline
19:18 the feature development process.
19:20 And thirdly is the every
compound engineering plugin.
19:23 This adds a whole suite of useful
slash commands and subagents with the
19:28 goal of making every feature easier
to develop than the last, helping
19:32 your project continuously improve.
19:34 Step six in the setup checklist is setting
up MCPs or model context protocol servers.
19:39 MCPs are integrations that connect Claude
Code to external tools and services.
19:44 They're incredibly useful because
they let Claude interact with your
19:47 database, test your front end, deploy
to hosting and do all sorts of other
19:52 things that it couldn't do otherwise.
19:54 So which MCPs should you
set up for a new project?
19:58 This is where your tech stack from
the plan phase comes in handy.
20:01 You might not need all of them,
but try out the MCPs for key
20:04 parts of your tech stack that you
think would speed up your work.
20:07 For database work, I usually set up the
MCP for whichever database I'm using.
20:12 For example, the MongoDB,
MCP or the Supabase, MCP.
20:16 This is especially important when
you're rapidly iterating and adding
20:19 features 'cause Claude can just update
your database schema automatically.
20:23 For web apps, I recommend using the
playwright MCP or the puppeteer MCP.
20:27 These help Claude Code see your web app in
action, which is super useful for things
20:32 like automatically testing user flows.
20:34 Other MCPs from my recommended tech stack
include the Vercel MCP for deployment,
20:39 the Mixpanel MCP for analytics and
the linear MCP for project management.
20:44 To connect MCPs, just follow the
commands in the docs for the MCP server
20:48 of your choice, there's usually a one
line install to add it to Claude Code.
20:53 Step seven, and the final step
in the setup checklist is setting
20:57 up slash commands and subagents.
20:59 Now, both slash commands and subagents
are automated ways for Claude to perform
21:04 specific tasks and workflows, but they
work differently and understanding
21:08 the difference is really important.
21:10 A slash command is a shortcut
to a prompt or a task.
21:13 It uses the same context window
as your main conversation.
21:17 In contrast, a subagent is a
specialized agent for a specific task.
21:22 It uses a fork of your context window,
which means that it's unrelated to your
21:26 main conversation and other subagents.
21:29 Now, this means that subagents don't
know about each other this makes them
21:32 perfect for parallel work and specialized
tasks that need focused context.
21:37 You can use the built-in slash commands
and subagents that come with Claude Code.
21:41 You can use third party ones
from plugins, or you can even
21:45 create your own custom ones.
21:47 Let's double click into subagents.
21:49 For subagents, I like to use the
built-in subagents for planning and
21:53 code base search in Claude Code.
21:54 They work great out of the box and you
can invoke them manually or let Claude
21:58 use them automatically when it sees fit.
22:01 You can also create custom subagent, and
if you're looking for ideas, here are
22:05 three that I recommend for new projects.
22:07 First up is a change log subagent to
create and update change log entries
22:12 After we've finished a feature.
22:13 Then there's a front end testing subagent,
a specialized agent that focuses just
22:18 on testing your front end and can
run playwright tests automatically.
22:22 And third is a retro agent that
reflects on what can be improved
22:27 after a development session.
22:28 And then it updates things like
your Claude.md, your prompts, your
22:32 slash commands with its learnings.
22:34 The retro agent can become the
foundation for a continuous
22:37 improvement system for your project.
22:40 Now for slash commands, from the
anthropic plugin, there are some great
22:44 ones like the slash commit and slash
PR commit for committing changes.
22:48 I like to use the feature dev
slash command all the time.
22:51 And of course, you can also create
your own custom slash commands.
22:55 For example, I have a slash command that
updates all my project docs from the
22:59 automatic documentation in step five of
the checklist based on recent changes.
23:04 And then I have another one that
creates GitHub issues based on an input
23:08 project spec or a prompt that I give it.
23:11 Now I'm sure you can see how custom slash
commands and subagents close the loop on
23:15 some of the other setup steps like the
automated documentation and plugins and
23:19 MCPs from earlier in the setup Checklist.
23:22 So that's the seven step setup checklist.
23:25 But before we move on to phase three,
I wanna share two bonus advanced setup
23:29 tips that'll save you a ton of time.
23:31 These are not strictly required,
but I find them useful for
23:34 advanced Claude Code users.
23:36 Bonus step number one is to
pre-configure permissions and settings.
23:40 This allows you to pre-approve or pre
block certain commands so that Claude
23:44 Code doesn't have to ask you, or you don't
have to prevent Claude from running them.
23:49 For example, if you want Claude Code to
always be allowed to run git commands
23:53 or edit files without asking you, you
can specify that in your settings.
23:57 Pre configuring your permissions helps
avoid the frustrating problem of thinking.
24:01 Claude is working on something, going to
get a cup of coffee and then coming back
24:05 to find that Claude was actually stuck
waiting for permission the entire time.
24:10 Bonus step number two is to set
up hooks for advanced automation.
24:14 Hooks, let you insert determinism
into your Claude Code workflow.
24:18 There are basically scripts that can run
automatically at certain points in the
24:22 Claude Code lifecycle, like before a tool
call or after Claude finishes a task.
24:27 For example, I use a stop hook that
checks if test pass when Claude finishes
24:32 and if they don't, the hook tells
Claude to keep going and to fix them.
24:36 Another example of a hook that I use
is a notification hook that pings me
24:40 on Slack when Claude needs permission
to do something so I don't have
24:43 to be at my terminal all the time.
24:45 Hooks are pretty advanced and they can
seem intimidating, but I highly recommend
24:49 you try them out and think about even
just one hook that you can use in your
24:53 workflow after watching this video.
24:55 This brings us to the
end of the setup phase.
24:58 At this point, Claude has everything it
needs to start building your project.
25:02 Next up is the final phase of
the PSB process, the part that
25:06 you've all been waiting for.
25:07 The build phase where we can finally
start writing code with Claude.
25:11 Alright.
25:12 Phase three is the build phase.
25:14 This is where we'll start building
our new project with Claude.
25:17 And just as with the plan and the setup
phases, having the right workflows in
25:21 the build phase makes all the difference
between frustration and smooth sailing.
25:26 So in this section, we're not only
gonna cover building your MVP with
25:29 Claude, but we'll also cover three
workflows that I recommend in general
25:33 for building new features with Claude
Code, plus the most important tips
25:37 that I've learned to keep your building
process productive and efficient.
25:42 Let's get into it.
25:43 First up is asking
Claude to build your MVP.
25:46 At this point you have your project
Spec Doc and your milestones
25:49 for your project documented.
25:51 The next step is to have Claude
Build Milestone one of your
25:54 project based on your project spec.
25:57 A pro tip here is to ask Claude
to use parallel subagents where
26:00 possible during the implementation.
26:02 This can speed up the development
process significantly because
26:05 Claude can work on multiple parts
of your project at the same time.
26:09 And as always, I recommend using
plan mode first so that Claude can
26:13 translate your project spec into its own
implementation plan for better results.
26:18 Now that you've built your MVP, let's
talk about how to build the rest
26:21 of the milestones in your project.
26:23 I am gonna share the three
workflows that I use the most
26:26 when developing with Claude Code.
26:28 They are the general workflow,
the issue-based workflow,
26:31 and the multi-agent workflow.
26:34 First up is a general workflow.
26:36 This is what I recommend using when
developing a single feature end to end.
26:40 The general workflow has four
parts, research, plan, implement.
26:45 And lastly, test.
26:47 Research can involve asking Claude
to create a research report or
26:50 even using external research you've
done in ChatGPT deep research.
26:55 Now the research step is optional, but
I found it helpful for bigger features
26:59 where Claude needs to make tech stack
decisions or look up specific APIs
27:03 that I'm using for the first time.
27:05 The plan step in the general workflow
is perhaps the most important part.
27:10 In fact, the most common mistake
I see people make with Claude Code
27:13 is not using plan mode enough.
27:15 When Claude is in plan mode, it'll
think through the task, break it down
27:19 into steps, and ask you clarifying
questions before it starts building.
27:23 This leads to way better results.
27:25 And during implementation and testing
claude will automatically use all the
27:29 plugins, sub-agents, MCPs and slash
commands that we set up in phase
27:33 two to help with implementation.
27:36 One example that I like to use
explicitly is the feature dev slash
27:40 command from the anthropic plugin.
27:42 You're probably realizing that this
is where all the configuration that we
27:45 did in the setup phase comes in handy
as it helps us speed up development.
27:49 Next up is workflow two, which
is issue-based development.
27:53 In this workflow, GitHub
issues become your source of
27:56 truth for features and tasks.
27:59 Rather than only prompting Claude
directly, you can create GitHub issues
28:03 describing bugs, improvements, and new
features, and ask Claude to work on them.
28:08 This is part of the reason why we
set up a GitHub repo for our project
28:11 in the setup phase of this video.
28:13 It helps keep the project tidy because
GitHub is your source of truth versus
28:17 having several to-do files or feature
MD docs lying around in your repo.
28:22 For issue-based development, you need
to be disciplined about splitting
28:25 your work into GitHub issues.
28:27 Now the good news is that you can
ask Claude code to help take your
28:31 project spec and your milestones
and turn them into GitHub issues.
28:35 And of course, you can also
create issues manually on the fly.
28:38 If you like the issue-based
workflow, you can also automate it
28:41 with a slash command or sub-agent.
28:43 For example, I have a slash command
that takes in a file or folder and
28:47 outputs a list of GitHub issues
in my repo using the GitHub CLI.
28:51 Another benefit of the issue-based
development workflow is that it makes
28:54 it easier to do work in parallel.
28:56 We will cover multi-agent workflows
in just a moment in workflow three.
29:00 But conceptually, using GitHub
issues means you can ask Claude
29:04 to tackle multiple issues using
sub-agents in the same session.
29:07 This is useful for fixing a bunch
of bugs quickly in parallel.
29:11 You can also use multiple instances
of Claude Code to tackle issues in
29:15 parallel, this is useful for adding
multiple bigger features at the same time.
29:20 Workflow three is about
multi-agent development.
29:23 It's the most advanced development
workflow and it enables you to work
29:27 on multiple features at the same time.
29:29 The multi-agent workflow is also
known as multi-clauding in Claude Code
29:34 because you run multiple Claude Code
instances at the same time with each
29:38 session working on a different feature.
29:40 Now you might be wondering,
how do they stay coordinated?
29:43 Won't the changes
conflict with each other?
29:45 This is where git work trees come in.
29:48 Git work trees let you have multiple
working copies of your repo in different
29:52 directories each on a different branch.
29:55 Git work trees means that each Claude
Code session can work in its own
29:59 work tree with isolated files while
still sharing the same git history.
30:04 And when your multiple instances
are done working, you can ask Claude
30:07 to merge the work trees together.
30:09 Either directly into the main
or into a feature branch so that
30:13 you can test and review further.
30:15 This is what I usually do.
30:16 I've used the multi-agent workflow
to work on three features at once,
30:20 and it's incredibly powerful.
30:22 But it does require some knowledge
about how to set it up and manage it.
30:26 So if you'd like a deep dive into
multi-agent workflows and git work trees,
30:31 let me know in the comments and I'll be
sure to make one if there's enough demand.
30:34 This brings us to the end of the
three recommended workflows that I
30:38 use when developing with Claude Code.
30:40 And before we wrap up, I wanna share
four helpful tips that I use for staying
30:44 productive during the build phase.
30:46 Tip number one is to use the
best models as much as possible.
30:50 This means using the newly released
Opus 4.5, or at least using sonnet as
30:55 much as you can Especially for important
tasks where quality really matters.
30:60 Now since Opus 4.5 was released, I default
to Opus for planning and complex tasks.
31:06 I then use Sonnet as an implementation
workhorse and only use Haiku for simple,
31:10 straightforward tasks and bug fixes.
31:13 The reason is simple.
31:15 The time that I save by using a better
model that makes fewer mistakes is more
31:19 valuable than the money saved from using
a cheaper model that makes more mistakes
31:23 that I have to spend more time fixing.
31:25 Plus, and this could just be me.
31:27 I like to live on the edge and see the
best of what these models are capable of.
31:31 So that's why I like to use
Opus as much as possible.
31:34 Tip number two is to periodically
update and tune your Claude.md file.
31:39 Now, we might have set up our Claude.md
file in the setup section, but as part of
31:43 this build phase, I recommend periodically
updating it as you add new features or
31:48 reach new milestones with your project.
31:51 A pro tip here is that you can create a
custom slash command to have Claude first
31:55 update your Claudemd file and then create
a git commit as part of your git workflow.
32:01 This ensures that your documentation
and code can stay in sync.
32:06 Tip number three is to
practice regression prevention.
32:09 When you see Claude make a mistake
don't just fix it and move on.
32:13 Instead, just type, hashtag or
pound on your keyboard to give
32:17 Claude an instruction that it will
then automatically incorporate
32:21 into the relevant claude.md file.
32:23 This allows you to quickly
update your Claude.md file on
32:26 the fly without manual edits.
32:28 And finally, tip number four is
don't be afraid to throw away work.
32:33 Remember, code is cheap, so if
something isn't working, especially in
32:37 the prototype stages, don't be afraid
to undo it or throw away a feature
32:41 completely and start again as this can
often help you get to a solution that
32:45 you're actually happy with faster.
32:47 Claude Codes.
32:48 Checkpoints and rewind
are very useful here.
32:52 It gives you session level recovery
in addition to the project level
32:55 version control that you get with git.
32:57 And that brings us to the end of
the tips to keep you productive when
33:01 building with Claude Code and to the
end of phase three, the build phase.
33:05 Now if you wanna apply the system from
